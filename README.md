# Modified-mnist

This report discusses the results of a technical test for Queenâ€™s CS PhD application under the
supervision of Professor Steven Ding. The task is image classification for modified MNIST
dataset which can be found in the link[1]. Task 1 is to use models including logistic regression,
vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to train the
dataset. Examples from github[2] are used to help build the models and validate the results.
Task 2 is to implement the gated convolutional neural network (GCN) developed by Dauphin et
al. to train the dataset. All codes are written in Python with TensorFlow and can be found in the
github repository[4].
